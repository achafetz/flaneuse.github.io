### Background:
For a client organization that has lots of different partners working across Rwanda, it becomes a challenge to
know where everyone is working to coordinate efforts.

<br>

### Solution:
After compiling, cleaning, and georeferencing data on partner activities, I built a customized
[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboard. Partners are allowed to view where everyone in a
project is working, filter based on topic area or partner, and find partners working in a similar
topic area or region of Rwanda.

<br>

These visualizations are being used a demo site for an on-going project to improve partner coordination.
Based on user feedback, we are re-designing the website to collect data and visualize it with an improved
user experience which allows them to analyze and prioritize collaborations.
